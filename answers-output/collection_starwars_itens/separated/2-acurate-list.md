Back with even more figures for Revenge of the Sith, collecting all of these little bottle cap figures is proving to be a bit more of a task than I thought it would be… but I’ve already come this far, right? Right?! With the lack of available information for this small sub-line, I thought I’d put together a quick checklist for any other collectors that get the bug to collect these little guys. These figures were manufactured by Suntory and released in 2005 as part of a promotional campaign for the third movie. Episode III saw the release of 60 unique bottle cap figures in this series, bringing the total number of these bottle cap figures up to 154 (including secret/chase figures). These figures were given away with Pepsi purchases, and were only available in Japan. As with the the previous posts for Episode I & Episode II , most of this information has been gained from through Google Translate and a few low quality scans of promotional materials.
