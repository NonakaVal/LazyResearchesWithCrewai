After comparing the Nintendo GameCube Silver Japan edition with similar products in the market, it can be observed that the Nintendo GameCube offers a compact design with four controller ports, ergonomic controller design, and small but large-capacity discs. The console uses 8 cm optical GameCube Game Discs with approximately 1.5 GB capacity and operates at a transfer rate of 16 Mbit/sâ€“25 Mbit/s in CAV mode. It also includes 4 controller ports, 2 memory card slots, and a MultiAV analog audio/video port supporting interlaced composite, Y/C (NTSC models only), and RGB (PAL). The GameCube was released in Japan on September 14, 2001.

In comparison to other similar products like Sony PlayStation 2, Sony PlayStation 4, Microsoft Xbox 360, and Nintendo Switch, the Nintendo GameCube stands out for its unique design, compact size, and specific features like the small but large-capacity discs. However, it may face weaknesses in terms of storage capacity and compatibility with newer technologies.
