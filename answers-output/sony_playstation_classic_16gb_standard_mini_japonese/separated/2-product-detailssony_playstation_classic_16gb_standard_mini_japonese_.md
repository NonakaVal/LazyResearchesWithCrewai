It uses the ReARMed branch of the free and open-source emulator PCSX.

Reviews and opinions about the PlayStation Classic vary. Some users find it to be a fun throwback experience, appreciating the attractive and easy-to-use front-end menu system. However, others criticize the console for its weak graphics, limited settings, and poor emulation quality.
