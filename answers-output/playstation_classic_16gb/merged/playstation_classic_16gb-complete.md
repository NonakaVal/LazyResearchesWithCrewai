PlayStation Classic Review: the games are great but the emulation is really poor | Eurogamer.net

With its remarkable, varied game library, the original PlayStation stands as one of the best console platforms in gaming history. The PlayStation Classic was expected to be a smart move by packaging 20 great PlayStation games in a small plug-and-play replica of the original console. However, the PlayStation Classic falls short of expectations due to poor emulation quality.

The PlayStation Classic is powered by a MediaTek system-on-chip with an entry-level ARM Cortex A35 quad-core cluster, an integrated PowerVR GE8300 GPU, 1GB of DDR3 memory, and 16GB of flash storage. Despite this hardware setup, the emulation performance is disappointing. The console is limited to 720p output without any video enhancement features, resulting in poor image quality and blurry visuals.

The choice of emulation software, PCSX ReARMed, leads to various glitches and performance issues. The inclusion of European PAL versions of games further exacerbates the problems, causing significant judder and frame rate drops. The overall performance of the PlayStation Classic is inconsistent and fails to match the fluidity of the original console or other emulation solutions.

While the PlayStation Classic offers an attractive front-end menu system and a save state feature, the technical issues overshadow the gaming experience. The console's poor performance and technical shortcomings make it a profound disappointment, especially considering Sony's history of successful PS1 emulation.

In conclusion, the PlayStation Classic may still provide some fun with games like Oddworld, Final Fantasy 7, and Mr. Driller, but there are better ways to enjoy PS1 games. The technical problems and subpar emulation quality of the PlayStation Classic make it difficult to recommend as a viable option for playing original PlayStation games.
