Thought I'd make a thread as can't find one.
CAPCOM Biohazard Resident Evil 3 Remake Jill Valentine Collector's Edition 1/6 Statue
Bought the Japanese BioHazard version from ebay used. These collector's editions are sold out awhile ago. Had the learn that there's "knock off's" which are identified by a different box art and cheaper price.
Resident Evil 3's Remake Collector's Edition is built around its Jill Valentine figure. The statue is 11" tall and features the new design of Jill Valentine for the remake, as well as a base featuring the S.T.A.R.S. Raccoon City badge logo. It's a modern take on Jill's classic look with her blue shirt gunbelts, leg holster, and pistol. Another cool detail is that the Jill Valentine figure was designed to be similar to the Resident Evil 2 remake's Leon statue released with that game's collector's edition.
