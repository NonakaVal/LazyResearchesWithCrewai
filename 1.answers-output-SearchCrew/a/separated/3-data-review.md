Based on the search results, it is evident that there is a growing emphasis on data sharing practices in systematic reviews. Researchers are exploring strategies to improve data sharing, such as building a culture that normalizes data sharing, changing patterns in reporting and sharing review data, and promoting data and code availability statements in systematic reviews. The benefits of data sharing include increased transparency, improved understanding of individual trials, and maximizing the benefits of research investment.

To enhance research effectiveness, it is crucial for systematic reviewers to prioritize data sharing practices, ensure data availability upon request, and consider sharing data extracted from trials included in systematic reviews. By implementing robust data sharing policies and fostering a culture of openness and transparency, researchers can contribute to the advancement of systematic reviews in various fields.
