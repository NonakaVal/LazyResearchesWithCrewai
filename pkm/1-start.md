7 steps for prioritizing your workload
1. Write down all of your tasks: Compile a master list of tasks including daily, weekly, and longer-term tasks.
2. Determine which tasks are truly important: Distinguish urgent tasks from important tasks and use methods like Eat the Frog, Eisenhower matrix, or ABCDE Method to prioritize.
3. Stick to a schedule that reflects your priority tasks: Create a schedule based on task priorities and allocate time for each task.
4. Tackle your most intense, high-effort tasks first: Start with the most challenging tasks to maintain focus and energy.
5. Focus on one task at a time: Avoid multitasking and focus on completing one task before moving on to the next.
6. Acknowledge what you realistically can and canâ€™t get done: Be realistic about your workload and prioritize tasks accordingly.
7. If possible, make prioritizing tasks a team-wide effort: Communicate and collaborate with team members to prioritize tasks effectively.
