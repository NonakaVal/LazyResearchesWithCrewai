An effective operations strategy is crucial for propelling an organization toward success. It defines how an organization's resources are allocated to achieve its business objectives, optimizing business processes, fostering innovation, and driving sustainable growth. The strategy should align internal processes with external market strategies to ensure sustainable growth and competitive advantage. Operations strategy involves creating and optimizing processes, allocating resources according to cost and risk, controlling quality, managing the supply chain, and improving the customer experience.

Comparing strategy and operations, strategy involves setting long-term goals and making high-level decisions, while operations focus on the day-to-day implementation of the strategic plan. Core objectives of operations strategy include optimizing workflows, allocating resources, ensuring quality, managing the supply chain, and improving the customer experience.

To create an operations strategy, the following 8 steps are recommended:
1. Define objectives
2. Understand the audience
3. Understand the team
4. Evaluate current processes
5. Build actionable strategies and workflows
6. Align operations with go-to-market
7. Allocate resources
8. Implement and monitor

Best practices for effective operations strategy include staying agile, promoting a culture of continuous improvement, and defining key performance indicators (KPIs) to measure progress. Operations strategy software, such as Backlog, can help in keeping operations on track, teams in sync, and goals in sight.
