GitHub repository "crewAIInc/crewAI-examples" provides a collection of examples demonstrating the use of the CrewAI framework for automating workflows, including Marketing Strategy, Surprise Trip, Match to Proposal, Find Job Candidates Demo, Create Job Posting, Game Generator, Trip Planner, Create Instagram Post, Markdown Validator, Using Azure OpenAI API, Starter Template, Stock Analysis, Landing Page Generator, and CrewAI + LangGraph.

GitHub repository "majacinka/crewai-experiments" showcases experiments with a team of AI agents for tasks like examining startup ideas, building AI newsletters with Google SERP and Reddit Scraper, and more. The experiments involve using various LLMs available through API calls like OpenAI GPT-4 and Gemini Pro, as well as local models like Mistral 7B, Nous Hermes 7B, Starling 7B, Llama 2 13B, and Phi-2. The results varied in coherence and relevance, with some models producing generic content and others struggling to understand the tasks assigned.

These repositories provide valuable insights into the practical applications of CrewAI and the challenges faced when working with AI agents for complex tasks. The experiments highlight the importance of selecting the right models and tools for specific tasks to achieve desired outcomes effectively.
